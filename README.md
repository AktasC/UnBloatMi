# UnBloatMi
Xiaomi MIUI bloat software remover<br/>

UnBloatMi can Move, Restore and Delete Bloatware from your Xiaomi MIUI (8) device.<br/>
It let's you choose what to remove and what to keep.<br/>
You can edit the script to set the backup location.<br/>

You need to have TWRP Recovery installed.<br/>
BACKUP YOUR DEVICE BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT!!! (I recommend using TWRP Backup)<br/>

Usage:
- Move the ZIP file to your SDCard, and install using TWRP Recovery<br/>
- The first run, you'll be asked what apps to remove. Backups are automatically made<br/>
You can confirm each app, or choose to only confirm the more risky apps.<br/>
- If you run the script again (after testing your installation), it will detect the backups from the previous run.<br/>
You can then choose to restore the backup files, or delete them from your device.<br/>

Feel free to edit and change the script.<br/>
If you make any improvements, please let me know so I can add them to the script.<br/>
You can find the script in: /META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary<br/>
Instructions can be found in the comments of that file.
